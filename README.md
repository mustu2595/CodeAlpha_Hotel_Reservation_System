### Tips for Customization

1. **Payment Integration**: For real-world applications, integrate with a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal.
2. **Database Integration**: Use a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for persistent storage of rooms and reservations.
3. **User Interface**: Enhance the user interface with JavaFX for a desktop application or a web framework like Spring Boot for a web application.
4. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and validation.
